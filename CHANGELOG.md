## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Export As: File > Export As > PDF — export current document as a styled PDF
- Export As: File > Export As > HTML — export current document as a standalone HTML file with inline styles

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Tab context menu: right-click any tab for Show in Finder, Copy Path, Close Tab, Close Other Tabs, Close Tabs to the Right
- README updated with features from v0.2.0–v0.3.1 (favorites, keyboard shortcuts, resizable panes, clickable links, Find in Folder, tab context menu)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Find in Folder: right-click any folder in the file browser → "Find in Folder" to search filenames and file content within that folder
- Find in Folder: results show filename matches and content matches grouped by file with relative paths
- Find in Folder: depth-limited recursive search (10 levels, 5000 file cap, 1000 result cap) with match highlighting

### Fixed

- Tab bar: newly opened tabs that are off-screen now auto-scroll into view

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Per-document undo history: Cmd+Z no longer crosses tab boundaries — each tab now has its own independent undo/redo stack via per-tab EditorState isolation

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Clickable links in preview: local `.md` file links open in a new editor tab, external links open in default browser
- Link resolution: handles relative paths (`./`), directory traversal (`../`), and absolute paths
- Visual distinction for external links (↗ indicator)

### Fixed

- App hangs on launch: directory watcher with depth 5 exhausted file descriptors (EMFILE) on large folder trees — reduced depth to 2 and added resource limit error handling

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts for all formatting actions: Bold (⌘B), Italic (⌘I), Strikethrough (⌘⇧X), Inline Code (⌘E), Code Block (⌘⇧C), Heading Cycle (⌘⇧H), Bullet List (⌘⇧L), Numbered List (⌘⇧O), Link (⌘K), Horizontal Rule (⌘⇧-), Blockquote (⌘⇧.)
- Heading cycle shortcut: ⌘⇧H cycles none → H1 → H2 → H3 → none
- File browser: refresh tree on window focus to catch filesystem changes missed by watcher

### Fixed

- Tab switching no longer inherits scroll position from the previous tab — each tab saves and restores its own scroll offset and cursor position
- File browser now detects changes in nested subdirectories (watcher depth increased from 1 to 5)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Favorites panel above file browser: pin frequently-used files and folders for quick access
- Favorites: click folder to open in browser, click file to open in editor
- Favorites: drag-and-drop reordering
- Favorites: stale path detection (muted/italic for missing paths, e.g. unmounted drives)
- File browser context menu: "Copy Path" option for files and folders
- File browser context menu: "Add to Favorites" / "Remove from Favorites" toggle
- Resizable file browser pane: drag the 6px handle between file browser and editor (120–360px range)
- Resizable editor/preview split: drag handle between editor and preview with center snap (4px buffer)
- Both resize positions persist across app restarts and sync across windows

## [0.1.32] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- Repository renamed from `a_simple_markdown_editor` to `a-simple-markdown-editor`
- Updated auto-updater publish config and README links to match new repo name
- Replaced broken dynamic download badge with static badge

## [0.1.31] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

## [0.1.30] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- Cmd+Q requires two presses to fully quit — app windows closed but process stayed alive in dock

## [0.1.29] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- Auto-update download broken: artifact filenames had spaces which GitHub converts to dots, mismatching `latest-mac.yml` — now uses hyphenated `artifactName` for consistent naming
- Download errors now shown in update dialog instead of failing silently

## [0.1.28] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- File associations: app registers as handler for `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdn`, `.mdwn`, `.mdx`, `.txt` — shows in Finder "Open With" menu

- README download/badge links pointing to wrong GitHub repo

## [0.1.27] - 2026-03-02

## [0.1.26] - 2026-03-02
