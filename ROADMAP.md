## v0.1.11–0.1.22 — Security Hardening

> Status: **Complete** (Critical, High, Medium all resolved)
> Source: Adversarial code review (`The_Adversary/reviews/markdown_editor/REPORT.md`)

### Critical (Attack Chain: malicious .md → full filesystem compromise)

- [x] **C1.** XSS via unsanitized markdown preview — added DOMPurify before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- [x] **C2.** Unrestricted filesystem access via IPC — added `isPathAllowed()` validation (home + /Volumes, blocks .ssh/.gnupg/.aws etc.)
- [x] **C3.** Path traversal in `local-resource://` protocol — restricted to image extensions under home/Volumes
- [x] **C5.** `shell.openExternal` arbitrary schemes — allowlisted `https:`, `http:`, `mailto:` only

### High

- [x] **H1.** Bypassable regex sanitizer in `UpdateDialog.jsx` — replaced with DOMPurify
- [x] **H2.** `sandbox: false` on main BrowserWindow — enabled `sandbox: true` (chokidar runs in main, not preload)
- [x] **H3.** Missing CSP on settings window — removed dead standalone entry; tightened update dialog CSP
- [x] **H4.** `file:resolve-path` exposed `path.resolve()` — removed (was never called from renderer)
- [x] **H5.** Entitlements: verified all 3 (allow-jit, unsigned-executable-memory, disable-library-validation) are required for Electron
- [x] **H6.** No debounce on preview rendering — added 150ms debounce

### Medium (Code Quality)

- [x] **M1.** Duplicate CSS button styles — extracted to shared `buttons.css`
- [x] **M2.** Test artifact `Architecture_test_second_save.md` — deleted
- [x] **M3.** Unused settings standalone entry point — removed `index.html` + `index.jsx`
- [x] **M4.** `release.sh` `git add -A` — replaced with explicit `package.json package-lock.json` staging
- [x] **M5.** `buildAnchorMap()` rebuilt on every scroll — cached in ref, rebuilt only on content change

### Low / Deferred

- [ ] **L1.** No test framework — add Vitest
- [ ] **L2.** No linting — add ESLint + Prettier
- [ ] **M8/M9.** Decompose `App.jsx` (643 lines) and `FileBrowser.jsx` (505 lines) into custom hooks

---

## v0.1.23–0.1.24 — Preview Header & Scroll Fix

> Status: **Complete**

- [x] Preview pane header bar: show full file path in the empty space above the preview (mirrors toolbar height), with "Show in Finder" and "Copy Path" buttons
- [x] Scroll sync fix: when scrolling editor to the very top, preview should also scroll to top — snaps to 0 when sourceScroll ≤ 0

---

## v0.2.0 — Favorites, Keyboard Shortcuts & Clickable Links

> Status: **In Progress**

### Favorites

- [x] Favorites panel above file browser (pin files and folders for quick access)
- [x] Click favorite folder → opens in file browser; click file → opens in editor
- [x] Drag-and-drop reordering within favorites
- [x] Stale path detection (muted/italic for missing paths)
- [x] Right-click context menu: "Add to Favorites" / "Remove from Favorites" in file tree
- [x] Right-click context menu: "Remove from Favorites" in favorites panel
- [x] "Copy Path" context menu option for files and folders in file tree

### Resizable Panes

- [x] Draggable resize handle between file browser and editor (6px visible bar, col-resize cursor)
- [x] Draggable resize handle between editor and preview panes
- [x] Editor/preview handle snaps to center with 4px buffer zone
- [x] File browser width constrained to 120–360px range
- [x] Both resize positions persist to settings and sync across windows

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- [x] Bold (Cmd+B)
- [x] Italic (Cmd+I)
- [x] Strikethrough (Cmd+Shift+X)
- [x] Inline code (Cmd+E)
- [x] Code block (Cmd+Shift+C)
- [x] Heading cycle (Cmd+Shift+H) — cycles none → H1 → H2 → H3 → none
- [x] Bullet list (Cmd+Shift+L)
- [x] Numbered list (Cmd+Shift+O)
- [x] Link (Cmd+K)
- [x] Horizontal rule (Cmd+Shift+-)
- [x] Blockquote (Cmd+Shift+.)

### Bug Fixes

- [x] Tab scroll/cursor position: save and restore per-tab scroll offset and cursor when switching tabs
- [x] File browser refresh: increase watcher depth from 1 to 5 for nested subdirectories
- [x] File browser refresh: reload tree on window focus to catch changes missed by FS events
- [x] Per-document undo history: Cmd+Z currently shares undo state across all tabs — each tab should have its own independent undo/redo stack

### Clickable Links

- [ ] File browser: delete folder (move to trash) via context menu
- [x] Preview pane: clickable links to local .md files open in new tab
- [x] Link resolution: handle relative paths
- [x] Link resolution: handle directory traversal (`../`, `./`)
- [x] Link resolution: handle paths relative to open folder root
- [x] Visual distinction for local vs external links in preview

- [ ] Add TypeScript config (`tsconfig.json`) and build tooling
- [ ] Migrate main process modules (main.js, ipc-handlers.js, store.js, etc.)
