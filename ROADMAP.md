## v0.1.11 — Security Hardening

> Status: **Planned** — Priority: **IMMEDIATE** (before any wider distribution)
> Source: Adversarial code review (`The_Adversary/reviews/markdown_editor/REPORT.md`)

### Critical (Attack Chain: malicious .md → full filesystem compromise)

- [ ] **C1.** XSS via unsanitized markdown preview — `Preview.jsx` uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with raw `marked` output; any `.md` file with embedded `<script>` or event handlers executes in renderer context. **Fix:** Add DOMPurify before rendering.
- [ ] **C2.** Unrestricted filesystem access via IPC — `file:read`, `file:write`, `file:rename`, `file:create`, `file:mkdir`, `file:trash` accept arbitrary paths with zero validation. **Fix:** Path validation restricting ops to workspace/open-file directories.
- [ ] **C3.** Path traversal in `local-resource://` protocol — no validation, can serve any file on disk (e.g. `local-resource:///etc/passwd`). **Fix:** Restrict to workspace directory + image extensions only.
- [ ] **C5.** `shell.openExternal` accepts arbitrary URL schemes — no validation before passing to OS. **Fix:** Allowlist `https://`, `http://`, `mailto:` only.

### High

- [ ] **H1.** Bypassable regex HTML sanitizer in `UpdateDialog.jsx` — single-quoted attrs, no-quote attrs, `javascript:` hrefs all bypass it. **Fix:** Replace with DOMPurify.
- [ ] **H2.** `sandbox: false` on main BrowserWindow — comment says "needed for chokidar in preload" but chokidar runs in main process. **Fix:** Enable `sandbox: true`, verify IPC still works.
- [ ] **H3.** Missing CSP on settings window (`src/settings/index.html`) and update dialog. **Fix:** Add same CSP meta tag as main renderer.
- [ ] **H4.** `file:resolve-path` IPC handler exposes `path.resolve()` to renderer — aids path traversal. **Fix:** Remove; do path resolution in main process only.
- [ ] **H6.** No debounce on preview rendering — `marked.parse()` runs on every keystroke. **Fix:** Add 150-300ms debounce.

### Medium (Code Quality)

- [ ] **M1.** Duplicate CSS button styles across `app.css` and `update-dialog/styles.css` — extract shared styles
- [ ] **M2.** Test artifact `Architecture_test_second_save.md` in repo root — delete it
- [ ] **M3.** Unused settings standalone window entry point (`src/settings/index.html`, `index.jsx`) — remove
- [ ] **M4.** `release.sh` uses `git add -A` — replace with explicit file staging
- [ ] **M5.** `buildAnchorMap()` rebuilt on every scroll — cache and rebuild only on content change
- [ ] **H5.** Entitlements: verify `disable-library-validation` is actually required, remove if not

### Low / Deferred

- [ ] **L1.** No test framework — add Vitest
- [ ] **L2.** No linting — add ESLint + Prettier
- [ ] **M8/M9.** Decompose `App.jsx` (643 lines) and `FileBrowser.jsx` (505 lines) into custom hooks

## v0.1.12 — Preview Header & Scroll Fix

> Status: **Planned**

- [ ] Preview pane header bar: show full file path in the empty space above the preview (mirrors toolbar height), with "Show in Finder" and "Copy Path" buttons
- [ ] Scroll sync fix: when scrolling editor to the very top, preview should also scroll to top — currently the first 1-2 lines (e.g. `# Title`) are cut off in preview until manually scrolled

---

## v0.2.0 — Clickable Links

> Status: **Planned**

- [ ] File browser: delete folder (move to trash) via context menu
- [ ] Preview pane: clickable links to local .md files open in new tab
- [ ] Link resolution: handle relative paths
- [ ] Link resolution: handle directory traversal (`../`, `./`)
- [ ] Link resolution: handle paths relative to open folder root
- [ ] Visual distinction for local vs external links in preview

---

## v0.3.0 — Toolbar Dialogs & Polish

> Status: **Planned**

- [ ] Link button: dialog to enter URL
- [ ] Image button: dialog with "Insert from file" and "Insert URL" options
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for formatting (Cmd+B, Cmd+I, etc.)
- [ ] Editor: bracket/quote auto-pairing
- [ ] Auto-save option (with configurable delay)
- [ ] File browser: drag to resize width
- [ ] Export to HTML / PDF
- [ ] Performance: large file handling
